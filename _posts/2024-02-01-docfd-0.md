# Introduction

Docfd is a TUI multiline fuzzy document finder with text editor and PDF viewer integration,
allowing you to jump directly to a search result with a single key press.

It was initially made out of frustration of not having a simple way
to navigate a collection of text files.
fzf and grep suffice up to an extent, but they are really designed for line
based input, not paragraph based input.
And, well, we don't typically write everything in a single line,
and we can't predict how a phrase might be split across lines, or even if
it's split across consecutive lines with no gaps inbetween.

We can roughly think of it as an interactive grep for both text files and PDFs,
but word/token based instead of regex and line based.

The word/token based approach
makes the problem of searching across multiple lines much easier,
as there is no meaningful difference between searching
in the same line versus multiple lines for a list of words/tokens.
The simplification obviously comes at the cost of expressiveness,
but for me I've concluded that I do very basic search most of
the time and don't end up using
regex at all.

As for searching through PDFs,
it came later after a user's suggestion.
I was initially hesitant in adding PDF support
as I predicted it to be a lot of work,
but ultimatley convinced myself it was worth the effort.
And it was! Both a lot of work and worth the effort.
